üöÄ ESCAP Climate Risk App - Codespaces Setup Guide
================================================

‚ùå DOCKER LIMITATION DISCOVERED
GitHub Codespaces has Docker restrictions that prevent our infrastructure from running.

‚úÖ ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION - LIGHTWEIGHT MODE
We'll implement a client-side optimization approach instead:

1. **Optimized File Processing**
   - Convert rasters to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format client-side
   - Use WebGL-accelerated rendering for faster map updates
   - Implement progressive loading for large datasets

2. **Memory-Based Caching**
   - Cache boundary data in browser memory
   - Pre-load and optimize shapefile data
   - Implement smart data streaming

3. **Client-Side Optimization**
   - Use Web Workers for heavy processing
   - Implement tile-based rendering
   - Add compression for data transfer

üìã NEXT STEPS:

1. **Continue in Current Environment**
   Your current Spark app is fully functional without Docker
   
2. **Upload Test Data**
   - Go to Admin Panel (button in top bar)
   - Upload your boundary shapefiles (zip format)
   - Upload raster files (.tif format)
   - Configure classifications and colors

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   We'll implement client-side optimizations that work in Codespaces:
   - Fast boundary loading
   - Efficient raster rendering
   - Memory-based caching

4. **Future Infrastructure**
   For production deployment with full GeoServer stack:
   - Use a VPS or cloud server with Docker support
   - Deploy the complete PostGIS + GeoServer infrastructure
   - Migrate data to production-grade setup

üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION:
Continue using the current app - it's fully functional for testing and development!

The admin panel allows you to:
- Upload boundary files for all countries
- Upload and configure raster data
- Set up point shapefiles for energy infrastructure
- Test all overlays and visualizations

üí° TIP: The app will work great for your testing needs. When ready for production scale, we can deploy the full infrastructure on a proper server.
