üöÄ DOCKER INFRASTRUCTURE - NEXT STEPS
=====================================

WHAT HAPPENED:
‚úÖ Docker infrastructure is now running
‚úÖ All services are started  
‚ùå Backend has missing Python dependency (aiohttp)

WHAT TO DO NOW:
===============

OPTION 1 - Quick Backend Fix (Recommended):
------------------------------------------
1. Run: fix-backend.bat
   - This will rebuild only the backend with the missing dependency
   - Faster than rebuilding everything

OPTION 2 - Complete System Rebuild:
----------------------------------  
1. Run: complete-fix.bat
   - This will rebuild all services from scratch
   - Takes longer but ensures everything is clean

OPTION 3 - Manual Steps:
-----------------------
1. docker-compose stop backend
2. docker-compose build --no-cache backend  
3. docker-compose up -d backend

AFTER FIXING:
=============
1. Run: check-status.bat
   - This will verify all services are working

2. Open your browser to:
   - Main App: http://localhost:3000
   - Admin Panel: http://localhost:3000?admin=true
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - GeoServer: http://localhost:8081/geoserver

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
If services still don't work:
1. Check logs: docker-compose logs [service-name]
2. Restart specific service: docker-compose restart [service-name]
3. Full restart: docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d

WHAT'S BEEN FIXED:
=================
‚úÖ Added missing aiohttp dependency to backend/requirements.txt
‚úÖ Created fix scripts for easy recovery
‚úÖ All Docker port conflicts resolved
‚úÖ Infrastructure is properly configured

RECOMMENDATION:
==============
Start with "fix-backend.bat" - it's the fastest way to get everything working!
