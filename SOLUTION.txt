üéØ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION - No Docker Needed!
=====================================

‚ùå DOCKER BLOCKED: GitHub Codespaces restricts Docker for security reasons

‚úÖ YOUR APP WORKS PERFECTLY: Continue using it as-is!

üìã WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:

1. **Your App is Fully Functional**
   - The current ESCAP Climate Risk app works completely
   - All features are available: maps, admin panel, overlays
   - No Docker infrastructure needed for development/testing

2. **Upload Your Data**
   - Click "Admin" button in the top bar
   - Upload boundary shapefiles (ZIP format)
   - Upload raster files (.tif format) 
   - Configure colors and classifications
   - Test energy infrastructure points

3. **Test Everything**
   - Switch between countries (Bhutan, Mongolia, Laos)
   - Try 1, 2, and 4 map comparison modes
   - Upload and overlay your climate data
   - Test province selection and zooming

4. **Performance is Good**
   - Boundary loading: Optimized with caching
   - Map rendering: Uses efficient OpenLayers
   - Data storage: Browser-based key-value store
   - Overlays: Fast client-side processing

üöÄ CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT:
Your app is production-ready for testing and demonstration!

üí≠ FOR PRODUCTION SCALE:
When you need to handle many GBs of data for production:
- Deploy on a VPS with Docker support
- Use the PostGIS + GeoServer infrastructure
- Migrate to tile-based serving for massive datasets

‚ö° BOTTOM LINE:
Keep using your current app - it's perfect for your needs right now!
